# iq-graphing

These are two scripts to assist with IQ data transformation for 
visualization in VTK.  One converts it to CSV for import, while the other
creates a native VTK file for viewing directly.

Data files placed in the `data/` directory will be ignored by git to keep the repository reasonable in size.
